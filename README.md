# FanCo
FanCo is an advanced wind tunnel fan controller. Monitoring and regulating up to 120 fans individually with its custom UI or the API. 
The UI navigation is simple and intuitive utilizing just a rotary encoder.
FanCo is also capable of logging fan speeds over a longer period for later analyzation. 

FanCo is made up of two fundamental components. The master managing the UI and logging. And second, the slave, measuring actual speeds and compensate fluctuations in speed. Each Slave is capable of regulating up to 4 fans. Further slaves can be connected via cables to expand the maximum amounts of fans and also remove the number of control cables needed.
